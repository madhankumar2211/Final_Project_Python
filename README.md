# Final_Project_Python

I have tried it in 3 methods, all the 3 methods will satisfy the requirement given.

**request_flask_sqlite.ipynb:** - Method - 1

whenever data in a page are scrapped, that data is inserted into the database immediately. 
This step is repeated till all the pages are scrapped and inserted into the database.

**request_flask_sqlite_using_df.ipynb:** - Method - 2

I scrapped the data using requests and beautifulsoup module in python and convert that data into dataframe and insert that into the database.

**selenium_flask_sqlite.ipynb:** - Method - 3

I scrapped the data using selenium and convert it into dataframe and insert that dataframe into the database.
